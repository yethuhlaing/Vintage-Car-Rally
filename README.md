## Discussion on how the Web can be used for the Vintage Rally Club as a business tool 

Since the website allows online registration, the customers can easily do online-booking from our Mercy club’s registration page. The 24/7 website accessibility without holidays and weekends is a huge advantage to the customers. The website offers online visibility and enhanced recognition, which makes our business credible. Promoting our business on the internet and our website is much effective than face-to-face method. Our business looks reliable and authoritative when sponsored ads and promoted posts are linked to the website. 
  
## Further development for the website.

Our website will be able take the payment information and send them through a payment processor that validates the payment in the future. The “Thank you” page will be added to enable the customers to download our annual reports, get coupon code and upload their videos.  Our Mercy club will invest in professional photography for quality photo on website instead of hiring the in-house photographers. The website will be fixed for faster speed to get better ranking on search engines .
## How the website works for Disable users

My website is also specially designed for the disabled and supports popular screen readers. Visual elements are at a disadvantage to the blind users. In this case, the alt texts are inserted into images for descriptiveness when the blind uses screen readers using a synthesizer or Braille display. The motor-disabled individuals who are difficult to use mouse or touch devices can use keyboard Tab key for navigation links instead of mouse pointer. The website is compatible with Windows browsers and Mac browsers, which means the individuals with low vision can zoom into all or portion of the visuals. I also took into account for those with low color contrast sensitivity and designed my website with high color contrast between the foreground and background such as black letters on white background and vice versa. For the sake of deaf users, I utilized our rally club’ transcribed YouTube videos 

## Accessibility features of my own website.

1.	Colour combination with good contrast

- On the home page, I made a color colour contrast between background colour and text using black and white composition.

- In the Rally event section, I adapted the background color of description boxes to the color of vintage cars.

- My website is also set up for keyboard navigation accessibility. Individuals with motor impairments can use tab key can be used to navigate through elements on webpages instead of a mouse. The red colour will show the navigation.
